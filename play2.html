    <h3>The Duchess of Padua, by Oscar Wilde</h3>
    <p><h5 class="GUIDO">GUIDO</p></h5>

    <p> Well, I suppose you are right.  Ah!</p> <p class="stagedirection"> [_Just as he is leaving the stage
   with_ ASCANIO, _enter_ LORD MORANZONE _in a violet cloak_, _with a
   silver falcon broidered on the shoulder_; _he passes across to the
   Cathedral_, _and just as he is going in_ GUIDO _runs up and touches
   him_.]</p>

<p> <h5 class="MORANZONE">MORANZONE</p></h5>

<p>Guido Ferranti, thou hast come in time.</p>

 <p> <h5 class="GUIDO">GUIDO</p></h5>

   <p>What!  Does my father live?</p>

   <p><h5 class="MORANZONE">MORANZONE</p></h5>

   <p>Ay! lives in thee.
   Thou art the same in mould and lineament,
   Carriage and form, and outward semblances;
   I trust thou art in noble mind the same.</p>

   <p h5 class="GUIDO">GUIDO</p></h5>

   <p>  Oh, tell me of my father; I have lived
   But for this moment.</p>

   <p h5 class="MORANZONE">MORANZONE</p></h5>

<p> We must be alone.</p>

<p h5 class="GUIDO">GUIDO</p></h5>

    <p> This is my dearest friend, who out of love
   Has followed me to Padua; as two brothers,
   There is no secret which we do not share.</p>

   <p h5 class="MORANZONE">MORANZONE</p></h5>

    <p>There is one secret which ye shall not share;
   Bid him go hence.</p>
